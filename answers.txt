• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
-->
In Git, to "fast forward" means to update the HEAD pointer such that its new value is a direct descendant of the previous value.
If Master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the latest commit of the feature branch. There won't be any "merge commit" in fast-forwarding merge.

• Why should you have different branches?
-->  We can do or perform different tasks on different branches. If anyone one branch gets buggy, project and other work is not affected.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
 Multiple remote repositories can be used but only one origin exists.
